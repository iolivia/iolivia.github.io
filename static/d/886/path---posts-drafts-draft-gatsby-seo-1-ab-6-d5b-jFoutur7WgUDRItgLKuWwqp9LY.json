But what about SEO? Will people be able to find your blog or click on it if they find it through a search engine? Well, I was asking myself the same question about a week ago, so I'm going to walk you through my strategies for figuring out just how bad the SEO on my website was and what I did to fix it.</p>\n<p>First, I did a bit of digging on modern SEO techniques and I found a list of potential things to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meta tags and helmet</li>\n<li>Alt to images </li>\n<li>Headings size </li>\n<li>Backlinks</li>\n<li>Keywords (1, 2, 3 words)</li>\n<li>Broken links</li>\n<li>Typos?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alright, but let's see what we have so far, maybe Gatsby came up with some magic that we are not aware of. Spoiler alert: it didn't. So I found <a href=\"https://www.seocentro.com/tools/search-engines/metatag-analyzer.html\">a meta tag analyzer</a> and looked at the results. It was pretty bad. I felt like I was being told off by a website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/meta-tags-15b1f98068c8b7e6c60a3a3a87951d60.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Meta tags analysis\"></p>\n<p>But we did get a couple of hints on other things we need to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robots</li>\n<li>Twitter (and presumably other social websites) cards</li>\n<li>Open Graph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is what <a href=\"https://sitechecker.pro/\">Site Checker</a> (another SEO free tool) told me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/seo-score-1220fd4148920145f8eb29bcf6c1fa5b.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"SEO score analysis\"></p>\n<p>It told me some of the same things as the one above, but I got a couple of extra leads (we'll discuss these in more detail later on so don't worry if you have no idea what they mean):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Redirects</li>\n<li>Canonical URLs</li>\n<li>Anchors on external links </li>\n<li>Mobile optimization </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also tried to use <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console\">Google Search Console</a> but it takes a few days for Google to index the site and given I've just published it I couldn't see any data. </p>\n<p>I also tried <a href=\"https://website.grader.com\">Website Grader</a> and surprisingly it gave me <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>27/30</strong></span> on Performance, <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>30/30</strong></span> on Mobile, <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>10/10</strong></span> on Security and (here it goes) <span style=\"color:orange\"><strong>5/30</strong></span> on SEO.
