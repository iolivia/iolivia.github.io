I got some really touching feedback from some of the attendees after the event and I'm glad I could provide even a little bit of inspiration and insight into a career in tech!</li>\n<li>I ran the third edition of my \"Let's build Amazon Video in 2 hours\" talk+workshop at the Prime Video offices in Santa Monica, California. It was absolutely amazing to run this for the third time, I had upgraded the slides and the content so much it was eseentially a new workshop around the same theme. The attendees were brilliant, they asked great questions which made me think and it was amazing to see them get what I was explaining and be excited about video ðŸ˜„</li>\n<li>Technically cheating but, I also mentored someone through giving the same talk, which was really important to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>travelling</h2>\n<p>I travelled a lot this year ðŸ›«</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 countries (3 of them for the first time)</li>\n<li>10 new cities (most notably Edinburgh, Bruges, Reykjavik, Santa Monica and Madrid)</li>\n<li>I saw more of my home country and I spent more time than I normally do with my family (which is a win-win)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>work</h2>\n<p>Work has been incredibly rewarding and eventful this year. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I helped <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125665/amazon-prime-video-comcast-xfinity-x1-streaming\">ship Prime Video on some million Comcast devices</a>  and I really grew as a result of this project. I was the tech lead for some of the video bits of this and it was truly incredible and satisfying to take this project from zero to a hundred in not that much time and finally see it in the hands of customers.</li>\n<li>I left Amazon ðŸ˜žðŸ˜„ to go work for an early stage startup, which was a really big step!</li>\n<li>I met <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Maisie_Williams\">Maisie Williams</a> and shortly after I joined <a href=\"https://daisie.com\">Daisie</a> ðŸ§¡. Very excited about the amazing team we have and what we are building. Excited and at the same time terrified about the launch, which can only be a good thing.</li>\n<li>Overall in 2018, I feel like I've become a better engineer and a better leader. I became more mature in my engineering decisions, I started caring more about the business and product impact of the tech, mentoring and helping others and generally trying to be a good example. I can't say if that worked (I'll leave that to you guys), but it's something I am going to keep working on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>health</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>this is the one aspect I've been failing on consistently in the last few years and 2018 was no exception. I tried eating healthier, exercising more, walking more, taking the stairs more, but the truth is it wasn't even close to what it should've been. Another improvement point for 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>books</h2>\n<p>I read a lot this year, 11 books (out of 15 planned, don't look at me with those eyes goodreads, I still have 2 and a half days to get this back on track).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I read more distopias - Handmaid's tale, The heart goes last and Farenheit 451 </li>\n<li>I discovered I love Margaret Atwood and I'm planning to make my way through more of her books (yes, I tend to find something I like and obsess over it, I can feel your judgement)</li>\n<li>I discovered Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan (mostly inspired by the TV show in all honesty) so I blame the length of his books for missing the goodreads goal really</li>\n<li>I read and wholeheartedly recommend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26030703-disrupted?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true\">Disrupted</a>. It was a fun little read and I would not be surprised at knowing how much of that is true. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>blog</h2>\n<p>Let's skip this one and get back to it for the 2019 review, shall we? (at least I deployed this site, that's something ..).</p>\n<p>2018 has been great, but I am really looking forward to 2019 and trying to break more boundaries.</p>","excerpt":"I've been reading a couple of year in review blog posts these days and I got inspired to write my own. 2018 has been a great year and it'sâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"2018 year in review","date":"December 28, 2018","tags":["year in review","2018","review","life retrospective"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/a1fbf162838f161addf7768f37a19d01/a4dcf/clocks.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a1fbf162838f161addf7768f37a19d01/c0e25/clocks.jpg 175w,\n/static/a1fbf162838f161addf7768f37a19d01/bdf3b/clocks.jpg 350w,\n/static/a1fbf162838f161addf7768f37a19d01/a4dcf/clocks.jpg 620w","sizes":"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2018-year-in-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/7-gatsby-deploy-github/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to deploy a personal Gatsby site to Github pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/fizzbuzz-in-10-languages/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FizzBuzz in 10 languages!"}}}}
