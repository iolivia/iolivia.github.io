One of the biggest challenges I had was finding the right architecture where things would be easy to build and any new feature should have clear steps on what patterns to combine to achive it. I started off with a basic inheritance model until I realized that was The Wrong Thing TM and switched to an Entity component system architecture (or ECS as it's most commonly referred to). I didn't find ECS immediately intuitive and I struggled a bit to think in ECS, so I figured I'd write a short post about my current setup and how I got myself to think more ECS and less in a traditional OOP way.</p>\n<h2>ECS overview</h2>\n<p>So what is ECS? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system\">ECS - Entity Component System</a> is a type of architecture and the gist of it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>separate data from logic</li>\n<li>composition over inheritance</li>\n<li>data oriented design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In ECS terminology you have these 3 basic concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entities: this is just a type of a thing referenced with an identifier (like a Player, Ball, etc.)</li>\n<li>Components: these are what your entities are made up of. For example, you can have a Renderable component, a Position component, etc. This is purely data storage.</li>\n<li>Systems: systems use entities and components and contain behaviour and logic based on that data. For example, you could have a rendering system which just iterates through all entities which contain renderable components and draws all of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it doesn't make sense yet, hang in there because a real example is coming.</p>\n<h2>ECS in practice</h2>\n<p>So let's talk a specific example. If you didn't read my previous post I'll just quickly describe what I was trying to achieve with this game. See it in action below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/people_to_courts-7b0c8ec951007ad4d5895716c3ca7618.gif\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"People going to courts\"></p>\n<p>So I wanted a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a floor, which is pretty much static and doesn't do anything</li>\n<li>people, which are tennis players</li>\n<li>tennis courts</li>\n<li>people should find an available tennis court</li>\n<li>people that have an assigned tennis court should travel to said court</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here is how that works in ECS terms. Let's start with components.</p>\n<h3>Components</h3>\n<p>So components are basically the simplest smallest piece of data that makes sense on its own (think an atom) and entities are just a composition of a lot of components. So let's try to break this down. </p>\n<p>We need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a way to assign an image or a list of images to an entity: for example, the court is made up of 8 images and the person is made up of 1 image</li>\n<li>a way to keep track of where each entity is on the grid</li>\n<li>a way to link a person to a court</li>\n<li>a way to link a court to a person</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Entities</h3>\n<h3>Systems</h3>","excerpt":"In the last post I talked about a small game I built in Rust and roughly how far I got in 24 hours.
