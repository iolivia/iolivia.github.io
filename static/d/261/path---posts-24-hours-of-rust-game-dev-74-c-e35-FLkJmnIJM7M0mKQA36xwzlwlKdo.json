The game is far from finished, but I thought I'd write up about my experience so far, what I've learnt and some interesting observations about building a game from scratch-ish and doing it in Rust. </p>\n<h2>Why Rust?</h2>\n<p>I picked Rust because I've been hearing great things about it and I see it's been having some traction in the game development space. I have to say at the point which I started this game I had written a few small programs in Rust, just enough to not feel like my hands were tied when I started writing the game. </p>\n<h2>Why a game and what game?</h2>\n<p>Making games is fun! I wish there was a more elaborate reason than that, but for side projects I normally prefer things that are quite far from what I do daily at my job. Now, what game? I wanted to make a simulation game with a tennis theme, think like Cities Skylines meets Zoo Tycoon with tennis and pixel art. I haven't got it all figured out yet, but it's basically a tennis academy where people come and play tennis.</p>\n<h2>The making of the game!</h2>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<p>I knew I wanted to use Rust, but I didn't know exactly how much \"from-scratch\" I wanted to make it. I didn't want to write pixel shaders, but I didn't want to use drag and drop either, so I had to pick something that gave me enough flexibility but also keep it interesting from an engineering perspective without going too low level. </p>\n<p>I found a few useful resources which I'll link here in case you want to have a look: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://arewegameyet.com/\">Are we game yet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev\">Rust game dev subreddit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kenney.nl\">Free pixel art</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In this post I'll talk about a small game I've been developing in about 24 hours in total (mostly in a few hour blocks during evenings orâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"24 hours of game development in Rust","date":"March 01, 2019","tags":["game dev","rust"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/4a6d17dbef066cb8aa461bc1f74a24b9/5aa81/design.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4a6d17dbef066cb8aa461bc1f74a24b9/25db0/design.jpg 175w,\n/static/4a6d17dbef066cb8aa461bc1f74a24b9/62b24/design.jpg 350w,\n/static/4a6d17dbef066cb8aa461bc1f74a24b9/5aa81/design.jpg 700w,\n/static/4a6d17dbef066cb8aa461bc1f74a24b9/11eb7/design.jpg 822w","base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.3333333333333335,"sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/24-hours-of-rust-game-dev/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/design-patterns/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design patterns"}},"next":null}}
