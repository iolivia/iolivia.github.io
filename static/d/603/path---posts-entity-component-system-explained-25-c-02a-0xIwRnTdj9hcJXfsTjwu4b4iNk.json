One of the biggest challenges I had was finding the right architecture where things would be easy to build and any new feature should have clear steps on what patterns to combine to achive it. I started off with a basic inheritance model until I realized that was The Wrong Thing TM and switched to an Entity component system architecture (or ECS as it's most commonly referred to). I didn't find ECS immediately intuitive and I struggled a bit to think in ECS, so I figured I'd write a short post about my current setup and how I got myself to think more ECS and less in a traditional OOP way.</p>\n<h2>ECS theory</h2>\n<h2>ECS in practice - high level diagram + the game</h2>\n<h3>Components</h3>\n<h3>Entities</h3>\n<h3>Systems</h3>","excerpt":"In the last post I talked about a small game I built in Rust and roughly how far I got in 24 hours.
