But what about SEO? Will people be able to find your blog or click on it if they find it through a search engine? Well, I was asking myself the same question about a week ago, so I'm going to walk you through my strategies for figuring out just how bad the SEO on my website was and what I did to fix it.</p>\n<p>First, I did a bit of digging on modern SEO techniques and I found a list of potential things to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meta tags and helmet</li>\n<li>Alt to images </li>\n<li>Headings size </li>\n<li>Backlinks</li>\n<li>Keywords (1, 2, 3 words)</li>\n<li>Broken links</li>\n<li>Typos?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alright, but let's see what we have so far, maybe Gatsby came up with some magic that we are not aware of. Spoiler alert: it didn't. So I found <a href=\"https://www.seocentro.com/tools/search-engines/metatag-analyzer.html\">a meta tag analyzer</a> and looked at the results. It was pretty bad. I felt like I was being told off by a website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./meta-tags.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Meta tags analysis\"></p>\n<p>But we did get a couple of hints on other things we need to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robots</li>\n<li>Twitter (and presumably other social websites) cards</li>\n<li>Open Graph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is what <a href=\"https://sitechecker.pro/\">Site Checker</a> (another SEO free tool) told me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./seo-score.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"SEO score analysis\"></p>\n<p>It told me some of the same things as the one above, but I got a couple of extra leads (we'll discuss these in more detail later on so don't worry if you have no idea what they mean):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Redirects</li>\n<li>Canonical URLs</li>\n<li>Anchors on external links </li>\n<li>Mobile optimization </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also tried to use <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console\">Google Search Console</a> but it takes a few days for Google to index the site and given I've just published it I couldn't see any data. </p>\n<p>I also tried <a href=\"https://website.grader.com\">Website Grader</a> and surprisingly it gave me <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>27/30</strong></span> on Performance, <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>30/30</strong></span> on Mobile, <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>10/10</strong></span> on Security and (here it goes) <span style=\"color:orange\"><strong>5/30</strong></span> on SEO. Some more hints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sitemap</li>\n<li>Render blocking</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>SEO checklist</h1>\n<p>To combine everything we found in the previous section, here is our checklist of things to do to make Google (and other search engines, trying to be inclusive here) love us <del>more</del>. I've ordered them by priority.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meta tags and helmet</li>\n<li>Twitter (and presumably other social websites) cards</li>\n<li>Canonical URLs</li>\n<li>Redirects</li>\n<li>Open Graph</li>\n<li>Alt text to images </li>\n<li>Robots</li>\n<li>Sitemap</li>\n<li>Headings size </li>\n<li>Anchors on external links </li>\n<li>Backlinks</li>\n<li>Keywords (1, 2, 3 words)</li>\n<li>Broken links</li>\n<li>Mobile optimization (+ Render blocking)</li>\n<li>Typos</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What now?</h1>\n<p>So far we haven't done anything with gatsby specifically, but that's because we were figuring out what to do. Next we are going to pick off one item at a time from the list and apply it to our gatsby website. </p>\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Make search engines love your Gatsby website, the complete guide to Gatsby SEO","date":"December 01, 2018","tags":[],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.3333333333333335,"src":"/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/5aa81/gatsbyjs-github.jpg","srcSet":"/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/25db0/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 175w,\n/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/62b24/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 350w,\n/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/5aa81/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 700w,\n/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/9224d/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 1050w,\n/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/ab94d/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 1400w,\n/static/38e401b61a7e7343225339891c87c6a7/19192/gatsbyjs-github.jpg 1914w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/draft-gatsby-seo/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/7-gatsby-deploy-github/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to deploy a personal Gatsby site to Github pages"}},"next":null}}
