Simple modulo operations to see if something is divisible by 3 and/or 5, a loop and printing to the console. It doesn't sound complicated. And it isn't, unless you are doing it in an obscure language you've never used before or in a programming paradigm which is less than common. So the thought occurred to me, FizzBuzz is actually perfect for learning a new language. It's simple enough, it doesn't leave much room for interpretation and we've all done it before in a language we are familiar with. </p>\n<p>So I thought to myself, why not use some time this holiday to experiment with FizzBuzz? Oh boy did I experiment. </p>\n<h2>javascript (node)</h2>\n<p>I started with JavaScript, more for calibration purposes if nothing else. To remind myself the problem and do it in a language I am very familiar with. Nothing special, here it is. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">for (let i = 1; i &lt;= 100; ++i) {\n  const divBy3 = i % 3 === 0;\n  const divBy5 = i % 5 === 0;\n\n  if (divBy3 &amp;&amp; divBy5) {\n    console.log(`FizzBuzz`);\n  } else if (divBy3) {\n    console.log(`Fizz`);\n  } else if (divBy5) {\n    console.log(`Buzz`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n}</code></pre></div>\n<h2>haskell</h2>\n<p>Then I thought, you know what I haven't used in a while? A functional language. I did a bit of Haskell in university so this wasn't soo unknown to me, but it wasn't super easy either. About half an hour. </p>\n<p>Command line language\nBash</p>\n<p>Compiled</p>\n<p>Script</p>\n<p>Functional</p>\n<h2>javascript (node)</h2>\n<p>well, I know javascript so this one was more for calibration purposes. it took me less than a minute to do it.</p>\n<h2>haskell</h2>\n<p>30 mins, not easy at all\ncompletely different way of thinking, knowning some of the concepts helped</p>\n<h2>rust</h2>\n<p>10 mins, not that hard\ncool pattern matching\nthe compile time is real (on hackerrank)</p>\n<h2>python</h2>\n<p>1 minute\neasy</p>\n<h2>ada</h2>\n<p>15 mins\nreminded me of Pascal\nnot that hard, weird syntax for declaring variables though</p>\n<h2>go</h2>\n<p>5 mins\nnot bad\nfor languages that I know or are not that different, it's kind of repetititve, so we're going to spice it up\nI actually forgot to save this code cause I was doing it all in an online console, but believe me you didn't miss much </p>\n<p>at this point i realized I have come up with a system and broken the problem down into the smallest parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to do a for loop (which most often comes with how to print as well whcih is handy)</li>\n<li>how to do modulos operator</li>\n<li>elseif </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>brainfuck</h2>\n<p>5 hours\nthis language really deserves its name\nsmall intermission to read this\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a\">https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.klipse.tech/brainfuck/2016/12/17/brainfuck.html\">https://blog.klipse.tech/brainfuck/2016/12/17/brainfuck.html</a>\n<a href=\"https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms#Summing_1.7En\">https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck<em>algorithms#Summing</em>1.7En</a></p>\n<p>breaking down the problem requires much more effort, super low level\nprinting something is not an option\nread some code on stack overflow and you're like: ah, I get it.
